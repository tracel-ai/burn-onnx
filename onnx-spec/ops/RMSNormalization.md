# RMSNormalization

First introduced in opset **23**

## Description

This is RMS normalization defined in ONNX as function as described in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467.
      The overall computation can be split into two stages. The root mean squared norm is taken over the last D dimensions,
      where D is the dimension of normalized_shape. For example, if normalized_shape is (3, 5) (a 2-dimensional shape),
      the rms norm is computed over the last 2 dimensions of the input. The computation required by standardization can be
      described by the following equations.
      ```
      XSquared = Mul(X, X)
      XSquaredMean = ReduceMean<axes=normalized_axes>(XSquared)
      MeanSquareEpsilon = Add(XSquaredMean, epsilon)
      RMS = Sqrt(MeanSquareEpsilon)
      Normalized = Div(X, RMS)
      ```
      where `normalized_axes` is `[axis, ..., rank of X - 1]`. The variables `RMS` stand for root mean square,
      Depending on `stash_type` attribute, the actual computation
      must happen in different floating-point precision.
      For example, if `stash_type` is 1, this operator casts
      all input variables to 32-bit float, perform the computation, and
      finally cast `Normalized` back to the original type of `X`.
      The second stage then scales the outcome of the first stage using:
      ```
      Y= Mul(Normalized, Scale)
      ```
      Let `d[i]` indicate the i-th dimension of `X`.
      If `X`'s shape is `[d[0], ..., d[axis-1], d[axis], ..., d[rank-1]]`,
      the shape of `RMS` is `[d[0], ..., d[axis-1], 1, ..., 1]`.
      `Y` and `X` have the same shape. This operator supports unidirectional broadcasting
      (`Scale` should be unidirectional broadcastable to tensor `X`);
      for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).

## Attributes

- **axis** (INT, optional): The first normalization dimension. If rank(X) is r, axis' allowed range is [-r, r). Negative value means counting dimensions from the back.
- **epsilon** (FLOAT, optional): The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero.
- **stash_type** (INT, optional): The floating-point precision used in stage one of the computation.

## Inputs (2 - 2)

- **X** (T): The input tensor to be normalized. In general, the shape is (D1, D2, ... , Dn) for n-dimensional data, where the root mean squared norm is taken over the last D dimensions, D is determined by the axis attribute.
- **scale** (V): Scale tensor. Scale tensor shape should be broadcastable to the normalized shape.

## Outputs (1 - 1)

- **Y** (V): Output data tensor. Same shape as X

## Type Constraints

- **T**: tensor(bfloat16), tensor(double), tensor(float), tensor(float16)
  Constrain input X type to float tensors.
- **V**: tensor(bfloat16), tensor(double), tensor(float), tensor(float16)
  Constrain output Y and scale type to float tensors.
